# TODO — High Leverage Actions

[ ] What if we add structure output to the stage agents?
[ ] What if we add the rdi skill to the orchestrator agent?

## 0. Get It Into Users' Hands (THIS WEEK)

- [ ] **Tomorrow AM**: Message Mattia, Francesco, Marian
  - "Can I get 20 min to watch you try π on something you're working on?"
- [ ] Ensure `git clone && make install && π "task"` works end-to-end
- [ ] Watch them use it. Note where it breaks.
- [ ] Ask: "What would make this useful for you?"

## 1. Make It Work

- [ ] Finalize core workflow (Research → Design → Execute)
- [ ] Ensure `make check` passes with 80%+ coverage

## 2. Make It Installable

- [ ] Package and publish to PyPI
- [ ] Write installation & quickstart docs (1 page max)

## 3. Grow (AFTER user feedback)

- [ ] Landing page with email capture
- [ ] Post on HN, Reddit, Twitter/X
- [ ] Iterate based on what users actually ask for
