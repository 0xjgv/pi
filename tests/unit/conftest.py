"""Unit test fixtures.

These fixtures provide heavy mocking for isolated unit tests.
Use the appropriate layer based on test scope (see root conftest.py).

Note: Most fixtures remain in the root conftest.py since they are shared
between unit and integration tests. This file exists for organizational
clarity and any unit-specific fixtures that may be added in the future.
